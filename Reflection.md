<br>

This task has been helpful in allowing us to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each individual on our team. That time for us to figure out our dynamics is incredibly important to helping us more effectivley and efficiently accomplish our goal. The biggest challenge we faced though was technical, but we worked through it as a team, and asked for help and landed upon a solution.

## Problems/Solutions

<br>

1) Our main problem was related to running Augur on a remote instance. We searched through the documentation and asked questions finally landing upon that we just needed more horsepower in our server. 

<br>

2) Another problem we faced was having an idea for what we wanted the scope of our app to be. That took some soft skills, some deliberation, until we landed upon the sembelance of an idea that we have now.
